# Financial Forecasting ML
## Forecasting of the Forex market using machine learning techniques

This project tries to answer to 2 questions:

1. Can we predict whether a candle will be up or down ? ( Classification )

2. To which extent can we predict the exact daily closing price of a currency ? ( Regression )

This project used Support Vector Machines ( SVMs ) and Neural Networks.

**Python 2.7** is needed to run these files

*Methodology:*
* Gather daily EURUSD and USDJPY data from Metatrader in the form of csv files
* Clean the data (we only need Open, High, Close, Low data )
* Create input and output sets for classification and regression (6 days were used to predict the 7th one)
* Create the mapping between the input/output sets for training and testing
* Train the models and test them
* Evaluate the models ( Accuracy for classification and Mean Square Error for regression )

*Sliding window (6 days to predict the 7th):*

## Results

For the **Classification** :
* Simple SVM gave an accuracy of 51.72%
* A 24-8-2-8-1 Neural Network gave an accuracy of 52.37%

For the **Regression** :
* Simple SVM gave an MSE of 4.99e-05
* A 24-12-1 Neural Network gave an MSE of 0.7357

## Things to improve the models :
* Try other algos ( GaussianBayes, Random Trees, K Nearest Neighbors ... )
* Do feature selection using Chi Square , or RFE ( and compare them )
* Do 5 fold cross-validation using TimeSeriesSplit ( from sklearn )
* Do GridSearchCV to find the best parameters ( or use RandomizedSearchCV if too exhaustive )
* Explore how the structure of the NN affects accuracy/MSE ( in terms of depth and length of layers )
* Use Recurrent NNs
